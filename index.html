                <p>Bento is a single-portion take-out or home-packed meal common in Japanese cuisine.
                A traditional bento holds rice or noodles, fish or meat, with pickled and cooked vegetables, in a box.
                <br>
                Containers range from disposable mass-produced to hand-crafted lacquerware.
                Bentos are readily available in many places throughout Japan, including convenience stores, bento shops, railway stations, and department stores.
                <br>
                However, Japanese homemakers often spend time and energy on a carefully prepared lunch box for their spouse, child, or themselves.(from Wikipedia)</p>
